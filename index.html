            “I'm an experienced software engineer who constantly seeks out innovative solutions to everyday problems. In my seven years in this industry, I've honed my analytical thinking and collaboration skills, and I love working with a team. I've also had the opportunity to serve as the software engineer lead for three projects with First Technology.

        “Before my current position, I was a junior software engineer with Mobile First. While working there, I committed to mobile system development, which has been my specialty for seven years. I understand that a major part of this role with your firm focuses on leading mobile development teams, which my previous experience has certainly prepared me for.”
